  "description": "The target is removed from the standard\npassage of time. Choose if they return\ninstantly or within the temporal range.\nThen choose if their experience is instan-\ntaneous or up to the temporal range.\nIf their experience is not instantaneous,\nthe target has that time for themselves\nwhile witnessing time move relatively\nfor others. The target may move around\nfreely, yet interacting with another being\nor object not on their person instantly\nends the spell.\nWhen returning, the target appears in\nthe unoccupied space nearest to their\ndeparture location."
